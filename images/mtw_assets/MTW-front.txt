Description: "Man the Walls!" puts players in the role of Gordon Freeman.

The Resistance fighters will run away and cower whenever they get shot, so the player must motivate these cowardly fighters by whacking them upside the head with his crowbar, in order to get them to fight again.

 "Man the Walls!" was an experiment in what could be done with Half-Life 2's AI scripting system with limited time and training.The level took inspiration from old arcade games like Galaga and Space Invaders.  To win the level, the player must ensure that at least one Combine computer survives.
