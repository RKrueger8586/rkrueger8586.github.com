mtw1:
The project had a strong focus on AI relationship and Assault scripting. The player must defend an abandoned Combine outpost through several waves of enemies.

mtw2:
The enemy AI follows a pre-determined path with prioritized targets. This allows them to systematically break down the outpost's defenses and finally move to their final goal of destroying the computers within.

mtw3:
I studied many of the City-17 levels in order to get a feeling for the construction of buildings in Half-Life 2.

mtw4:
The outpost is sectioned off by high buildings and fences. This area is the only area that the player has access to.

mtw5:
The player has access to a shotgun and grenades. The shotgun is ineffective at long range, and the grenade requires finesse and timing to use properly. However, at close range both these weapons are extremely effective.

mtw6:
The shotgun keeps the player fighting at close range, but the enemies have access to SMGs and the Combine AR-2, which is much more effective at long range.

mtw7:
The player and his allies must defend three computers. If the Combine destroy them, the player fails the level.

mtw8:
If the player manages to survive three waves of enemies, Alyx comes to the rescue, and assists the player in surviving the last wave of enemies.
