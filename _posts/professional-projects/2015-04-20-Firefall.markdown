However, they are ferr to choose what they want to do first: Get their weapons, Get their battleframes, or disrupt the EMP field that renders their jump jets useless. Intrpid players can even ignore all of these tasks and go straight for the wardens, armed with little more than some improvised weapons and harsh language."

## Description
Firefall is an MMOFPS hybrid developed by Red 5 Studios in Irvine, CA. I joined the team as a Senior Level Designer in April of 2015. I was one of two level designers at the studio.  My primary responsibilities were to work with the world building and scripting team to block out and create whiteboxes to showcase the updated combat mechanics, and create additional content for the players to go through during their leveling experience. 

We used the in-game tools and Google SketchUp in order to create and iterate on blockouts. Once the blockout was completed, we worked with scripting and world building to iterate and act on internal playtest feedback, altering the space as needed in order to work with scripts and needed artwork. 

Level designers acted as a liason between the scripting and world building teams, and would ususally organize people on the asigned teams to mitigate workflow blockages and ensure that evenryone was focusing their work in a productive direction and that the level blockout was completed with plenty of time to iterate and allow the appropriate level of polish.

Additionally, as a member of the combat team at Red 5, I took the lead on getting our third raid encounter fleshed out a ready for development.

## Development Time
- I worked on Firefall for approximately 7 months. In that time, I completed 4 missions, two raid encounters, one operation, one holdout mission, and several dozen open world areas. I also worked on refactoring several existing missions to work with the current state of our game.

## Tasks
- Create and document level blockouts for use by the scripting and world building teams
- Iterate and gather feedback on level layouts
- Place cover and iterate on open world combat spaces
