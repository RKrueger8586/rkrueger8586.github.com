## Description
The America's Army Visualization Platform is a suite of products aimed at satisfying the U.S. Army's needs for situational visualization problems. We handle multiple projects across several customers, each with vastly different goals. The Visualization Platform itself is a baseline from which other, more specific, products are created.

Much of my work has been focused around creating visually detailed, large scale, maps usually with requirements for geo-specificity. Most of these maps are supported by scripted scenarios with a specific training goal in mind. I started working on the Visualization Platform in May of 2010, and since then I have created 8 large scale environments, with dozens of scenarios to support the training needs of our government customers.

Throughout the last three years, I have taken on responsibility for the design and implementation of all of our content, and have secured a place as the Lead Designer for the project. I have worked with organizing multiple disciplines, including tasking and overseeing other designers and outsourced teams.

Due to the sensitive nature of the work I do for this project, I am unable to divulge specific details or images pertaining to the America's Army Visualization Platform.
