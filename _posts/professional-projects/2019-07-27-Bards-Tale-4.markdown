  label: Fantastic Dungeons and Clever Puzzles
  caption: "Bard's Tale 4 was created with a balance between exploring strange and fantastic dungeons, battling fearsome foes and solving devilishly clever puzzles. We created a wide variety of content and challenges for the player to experience."

  label: The Cellars of Kylearan's Tower
  caption: "A tutorial dungeon created to teach players the basics of many of Bard's Tale 4's systems. I designed and laid out a dungeon that touched on most of our major systems including crafting, puzzle systems, traps and exploration opportunities. After completing this dungeon, players should be ready to set out into the wider world of Caith."

  label: The Forest of Inshriach
  caption: "I did the inital design and layout for all of our overworld areas. The Forest of Inshriach is one of the largest spaces in the game and features over a dozen progression puzzles, a fast travel system, connections to several dungeons, and dozens of combat encounters. Players can seek out and clear the forest of corruption to restore it to it's natural state."

  label: The Village of Bren 
  caption: "Bren is a peaceful forest hamlet that acts as a hub for the player as they progress through the Forest of Inshriach."

  label: Baedish Lowlands
  caption: "I designed The Baedish Lowlands as an introduction to the features of our overworld areas. It is by far the smallest overworld zone, but still features several dozen combats, numerous puzzles including the tutorial for a puzzle system we called Faerie Golf. There are several connections to optional dungeons that we included as part of our kickstarter goals."

  label: Landmarks and Vistas
  caption: "We built all of our overworld zones with vistas and landmarks in mind, both to sell the flavor and personality of our world and to assist with player navigation. We set a goal that every prominent landmark would be a place of significance that the player could actually go to and explore."
- src: /thumbnails/bt4_07.jpg
  label: Advanced Combat Tutorial
  caption: "The Baedish Lowlands was also created to act as an advanced combat tutorial, introducing players to the concepts of synergistic ability usage, level differentials, and managing a larger party"

  label: The Isle of Stronsea
  caption: "The Isle of Stronsea is the last overworld zone before players reach the endgame. It is comparable in size and content to The Forest of Inshriach. Players must work their way from the docks on the western end of the island to the gigantic castle looming above the island to the east. This area features over 30 combat encounters, more than a dozen puzzles and links to six dungeons. "

  label: A Harsh Environment Choked by a Poison Mist
  caption: "The Isle of Stronsea was intended to feel very different than other areas of the game. We wanted to emphasize the harsh and rocky environments that can be found in the northern areas of Sotland to round out our visual themes."
- src: /thumbnails/bt4_01.jpg
  label: Deep and Tactical Combat
  caption: "The Isle of Stronsea presents the players with some of their greatest and most complex challenges. If not destroyed simultaneously, many undead minions will rise back up even after defeat. Players must make wise use of all of their skills to overcome these encounters."
- src: /thumbnails/bt4_08.jpg
  label: The Temple of Vildsvin
  caption: "A minor area in the game that I designed. It features some light exploration and a single combat, but we used this area as an opportunity to show off some of the more alien aesthetics of the Charn."
- src: /thumbnails/bt4_03.jpg
  label: Larger than Life Landmarks
  caption: "The Isle of Stronsea gave the team opportunities to create some truly larger than life structures and landmarks. We put a lot of work into making these features recognizable and memorable. The statue featured here was also shown in Mages Tale, the prequel to Bard's Tale 4. We wanted to use this statue to draw a subtle narrative line to the presence of the antagonists of both games, The Charn"
