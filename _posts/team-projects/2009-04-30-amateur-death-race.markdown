## Description

Amateur Death Race is a _Mario Kart_-style racer set in a silly, slightly futuristic world. Players control a magnetic vehicle and race against other players in order to cross the finish line first. Players must avoid metallic junk scattered along the track, or their increased weight will slow them down. However, being heavier has it's advantages. Heavier players are harder to push around.

My responsibilities included implementing the first third of the track, which included pick-ups, props, junk, level entities. I was also responsible for maintaining the LDD, giving presentations, and scripting items in the game world, such as exploding barrels.
