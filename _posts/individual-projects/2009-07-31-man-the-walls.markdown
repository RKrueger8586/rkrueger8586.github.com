  caption: "The enemy AI follows a pre-determined path with prioritized targets. This allows them to systematically break down the outpost's defenses and finally move to their final goal of destroying the computers within."

  caption: "The outpost is sectioned off by high buildings and fences. This area is the only area that the player has access to."

  label: Limited Weapon Selection
  caption: "The player has access to a shotgun and grenades. The shotgun is ineffective at long range, and the grenade requires finesse and timing to use properly. However, at close range both these weapons are extremely effective."

  label: Asymmetrical Encounters
  caption: "The shotgun keeps the player fighting at close range, but the enemies have access to SMGs and the Combine AR-2, which is much more effective at long range."

## Game
- Half-Life 2

## Description
"Man the Walls!" puts players in the role of Gordon Freeman. The player must defend three Combine computers from dozens of enemies with limited weapons, and four cowardly Resistance fighters. The Resistance fighters will run away and cower whenever they get shot, so the player must motivate these cowardly fighters by whacking them upside the head with his crowbar, in order to get them to fight again.

"Man the Walls!" was an experiment in what could be done with Half-Life 2's AI scripting system with limited time and training.The level took inspiration from old arcade games like Galaga and Space Invaders.  To win the level, the player must ensure that at least one Combine computer survives.
