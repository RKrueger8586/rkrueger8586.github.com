  caption: "The House of Commons is laid out like a fortress, despite its majestic architecture. The stairs act as a bottleneck, and cover is laid out to cover the entrances. The balcony mounted Troika machine gun offers an excellent line of fire over most of the battlefield."

Stranded was my first serious attempt at a Gears of War Level. The player must fight a desperate battle for survival against insurmountable odds, while completing several objectives that enable their escape at the end of the mission.

The mission focused on creating a highly detailed environment with numerous events and a smooth, yet challenging progression through the level.
