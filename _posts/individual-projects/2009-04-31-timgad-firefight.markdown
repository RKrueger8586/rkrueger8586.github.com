  caption: Lighting cues and environmental storytelling give the player a hint that there is something across the street worth checking out.

  label: Architecture 
  caption: "This area uses lots of squat and boxy buildings created from the Timgad architectural style. Most of the architecture sports darker color tones, and uses metallic or darker stone assets, as opposed to marble or brick.  The low power lines and overhead bridge help give the level a closed in feeling."

  label: Guiding the Player
  caption: "Placing a light source (such as a flaming Barrel) outside of the player's view of the alleyway from the street gives the area a feeling of depth and encourages players to explore the area."

  label: Encounter Design
  caption: "Dense, low cover allows both the player's squad and the Locust to advance in relative safety, but eventually both fronts come crashing together at full force. The shops and alleyway provide flanking opportunities and better cover, but sacrifice line of sight in the process, which creates brutal, close combat encounters."

  label: Alternate Routes
  caption: "The second story balcony offers players supplies and a height advantage, but first they must kill the locust sniper lying in wait."

  label: Risk Vs Reward
  caption: "The bridge to the second floor of the shops provides excellent line of sight, but absolutely no cover. The second floor shops provide excellent cover but little in the way of line of sight."

  label: World Building
  caption: "Towering buildings on either side of the level create a sense of space, but also enclose the player. If is easy to believe that this area is part of a much larger area."
